# Welcome to Bud's Design System

This is our design system storybook. It helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

Browse our components based on their package at the sidebar. You can click in a given component, and explore how it works. There are plenty of options and you can learn more about storybooks at [storybook.js.org](https://storybook.js.org/)

## Packages

Below, you can find a list containing all active packages in our design system:

* **@bud/core:** Core components for our design system
* **@bud/tokens:** Build system to centralize the definition of component tokens and assets

These packages are available at our [Github packages](https://github.com/budproj/design-system/packages)

## How to use it

### Installing

To install any of our packages, you must first configure your NPM to include the Github Packages registry. You can do so by editing your `.npmrc` with the following:

```
@bud:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

If you want to lear more, read the [documentation about installing a package from Github Packages](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages#installing-a-package).

Now, with the Github Packages binded in your `.npmrc`, you can install your package:

```
$ yarn add @bud/<package-name>
```

Each project has some peer dependencies, you can check those at the package's main documentation:

* [@bud/core](core-getting-started--page)
* [@bud/tokens](tokens-getting-started--page)
