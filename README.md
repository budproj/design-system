## 📖 About this

This repository is a monorepo, which consists of all design-system packages for our entire presentation layer. You can install each package separately, or the whole design system if you want.

Use those resources in your front-end applications to create a consistent visual signature for our products.

## 👽 Prerequisites

To install and use our design system packages, you must follow these steps:

### 1. Configure your Github Packages access token

We're using Github Packages to host our design-system resources. We've applied some of the required configurations in the `.npmrc` file at this repository, but you may need to add your token.

**IMPORTANT:** Don't add your token directly to the `.npmrc` file of this repository. You should add it to the `~/.npmrc` file in your home directory.
